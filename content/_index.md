Hugo is fun to use and maintain and almost always a zero hassle experience except
when it come building something from scratch I always felt that it would be great
if someone built a simple barebones starting point for people to build there 
websites and themes on Hugo, which is why I built this. This is not meant to be a
theme of a website for anyone but it could totally function as one if you don't
require much from your theme. I aim to make this a proper starting point from 
which you could build anything on Hugo.
